# Media Service

The Media Service plays a pivotal role in facilitating content management for educators within the platform. This service offers lecturers a versatile platform for uploading a wide array of multimedia content, encompassing diverse formats such as PDF documents, MP4 videos, PowerPoint presentations (PPTX), and more.

To ensure seamless accessibility and efficient storage, Media is saved using the MinIO object storage system, with various types of media stored in separate buckets within MinIO. URLs for uploading and downloading these files by using the GraphQL endpoint of the media service can be obtained.

By offering this comprehensive content management solution, the Media Service empowers educators to enrich their teaching materials with a variety of multimedia resources, facilitating a more engaging and dynamic learning experience for students. Furthermore, the streamlined organization of content and its easy retrieval from the platform's database ensures that educators can efficiently integrate and share these resources with their students.
