# Media Service

The Media Service plays a pivotal role in facilitating content management for educators within the platform. This service offers lecturers a versatile platform for uploading a wide array of multimedia content, encompassing diverse formats such as PDF documents, MP4 videos, PowerPoint presentations (PPTX), and more.

To ensure seamless accessibility and efficient storage, the uploaded content is securely stored in a blob storage system. Simultaneously, the service maintains an organized record of each piece of content by recording its respective path in a structured SQL database. This meticulous storage and indexing process not only simplifies content retrieval but also enhances data security and management.

By offering this comprehensive content management solution, the Media Service empowers educators to enrich their teaching materials with a variety of multimedia resources, facilitating a more engaging and dynamic learning experience for students. Furthermore, the streamlined organization of content and its easy retrieval from the platform's database ensures that educators can efficiently integrate and share these resources with their students.

In essence, the Media Service serves as a foundational component, seamlessly bridging the gap between educators' content and the platform's infrastructure. It enables the effective incorporation of diverse media types into the learning environment while maintaining robust data management practices, ultimately enhancing the overall educational experience.
