# Media Service

The Media Service is a component designed to fulfill the following functions within the platform:

1. **Content Upload and Management:** It provides a platform for educators to upload and manage multimedia content, including PDF documents, MP4 videos, PowerPoint presentations (PPTX), and more.

2. **MinIO Object Storage Integration:** To ensure efficient storage and accessibility, the service utilizes the MinIO object storage system. Different types of media are stored in separate buckets within MinIO, allowing for structured storage.

3. **GraphQL Endpoint:** Users can interact with the service through a GraphQL endpoint, enabling the retrieval of URLs for uploading and downloading media files.
